# Medellin, Colombia

Medellin is famous for its year-round temperate weather, surrounding mountains, and beautiful women.

## Pros

- Very cheap
- Perfect weather year round, expect for rainy season
- Many trees/greenery and surrounded by mountains
- Some areas are very modern
- Beautiful women
- Great culture

## Cons

- People don't speak English
- Not dangerous, but still you probably don't want to wander around alone at night carrying expensive electronics.
- Because of the influx of American sex tourists over the last decade, foreigners don't have a great reputation. Nobody really cares that you're a foreigner (which could be a positive to sum).
- Many prostitutes
- A local once described Medellin to me as the "Largest pueblo". Basically Medellin is a small city. This isn't inherently negative or positive.

## Where to stay

Most first-time foreigners stay in Poblado, which is where all the hostels and such are.

I recommend Laureles.

## Where to work

- Starbucks
- Al Alma
- WeWork
